    "# Convexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Both convexity and the curvature distribution are computed from the same surface. For a molecular dynamics simulation, the creation of that surface is computationally expensive, relatively speaking. It is likely best to compute convexity and the curvature distribution together. Our experience was that creating the mesh surface accounted for roughly half of the computational time, with the calculation of the curvature distribution taking up most of the other half. \n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, we recommend running a test of just a few frames to get the timing information and determine if you need to run the calculation in parallel or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, this code relies heavily on the PyTim package. This is the package that can compute the Willard-Chandler surface and turn a collection of atoms into an analyzable mesh surface. However, the PyTim package only seems to work on Linux and Mac operating systems. We're looking into re-writing the PyTim package to interface with Windows systems but that is not implemented at this time. There is, of course, the possibility that there's a required dependency for Windows that I have not properly adjusted for, so you can try investigating that option as well. "

    "The Willard-Chandler surface defines a continuous surface \"as the isodensity surface of a Gaussian kernel density estimate\". As such, it needs to know what Gaussian estimate of electron density to use for each type of atom. PyTim has default values set up for the CHARMM27, Amber03, and G43a1, but you will need to build your own dictionary for other force fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose is just to define where the atoms your interested in are, so small changes or errors in the Gaussian electron density should not impact your shape significantly. A simple copy of one of the pre-built dictionaries with a similar atom type mapping should be sufficient. PyTim may have a function to create this type of map for an arbitrary force field and we will look into adapting that into a useable function in the future. \n",

    "The actual creation of the Willard-Chandler surface is very easy and convenient with PyTim. The only catch is the output. We are using PyVista as a powerful and convenient package to handle manipulating, analyzing and visualizing the mesh. However, PyVista requires that the output be in a specific format. \n",

    ">[1,4,3]\\\n",
    "[1,6,9,2]\n",
    "\n",
    "etc. Where each number is the index of the point from the list of xyz coordinates. PyTim creates a Delauney triangulated mesh where every face on the surface is made up of only 3 points. However, in general a mesh can have faces of any number of vertices. So PyTim spits out a nice, concise array with only 3 columns, but PyVista requires a format that is more general to accomodate any number of vertices in a face. They do this by creating a flattened (1D) array where the first number denotes the number of vertices for that face, then the index number of each vertex in that face, then the number of vertices for the next face, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is all a long way to say that this is why the code looks a bit more complicated than it needs to be. We're just adjusting formats from PyTim to PyVista styles."
