Directories each have 20 frames from the appropriate simulation. Naming conventions taken from our 2024 paper. 

* "CHARMM" - CHARMM force field used for AOT and Isooctane, TIP3P water
* "CHARMM-4P" - CHARMM force field used for AOT and Isooctane, TIP4P/2005 water
* "OPLS-Std" - OPLS force field used for AOT* and Isooctane, TIP4P/2005 water
* "OPLS-CM5" - OPLS force field used for AOT* and Isooctane, TIP4P/2005 water
* "OPLS-RESP" - OPLS force field used for AOT* and Isooctane, TIP4P/2005 water

Note*: See paper for details about the force field used for AOT, which varies slightly between the 3 OPLS variations.
