## Organization
We provide the code as is, at the moment. One day, we plan to implement the code as a package that can be imported, but this will not occur quickly. To make use of the code, you will need to copy and paste the relevant functions into your own work. Thus, you may need to modify the code to suit your specific needs. For the most part, we expect any modifications will primarily be linked to the source of the data you are evaluating. We are chemists and this code is primarily designed for working with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations; any application outside of MD will likely require modification. For chemists performing MD, we used the GROMACS package and so had certain expectations of the file types. Make sure you update the code for your MD engine.
