## Organization
The code is being provided as is, at the moment. One day, we would like to implement the code as a package that can be imported, but that is likely a ways away. To make use of the code, you will need to copy and paste the relevant functions into your own work. Also because of that, you may need to modify the code to suit your specific needs. For the most part, we expect that this will mostly be linked to how you get your data. We are chemists and this code is primarily designed for working with molecular dynamics simulations; any application outside of that will likely need some more serious modification. For chemists doing MD, we made use of GROMACS and so had certain expectations of the file types. Make sure you update the code for your MD engine. We are trying to comment to the point of excess to make it easy on anyone who does need to make these modifications.
