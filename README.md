# How-to-think-about-Shape
Publicly available code supporting our paper, "How to Characterize Amorphous Shapes: The Tale of a Reverse Micelle". The paper is currently available on ChemRxiv and under consideration for the Journal of Physical Chemistry B. Please cite the paper if you make use of these shape metrics (we will update the citation information as we move through the editorial process).

## Organization
The code is being provided as is, at the moment. One day, we would like to implement the code as a package that can be imported, but that is likely a ways away. To make use of the code, you will need to copy and paste the relevant functions into your own work. Also because of that, you may need to modify the code to suit your specific needs. For the most part, we expect that this will mostly be linked to how you get your data. We are chemists and this code is primarily designed for working with molecular dynamics simulations; any application outside of that will likely need some more serious modification. For chemists doing MD, we made use of GROMACS and so had certain expectations of the file types. Make sure you update the code for your MD engine. We are trying to comment to the point of excess to make it easy on anyone who does need to make these modifications. 

## Commenting

I realize that many people on here have ample experience with coding and that this code is not particularly difficult. The comments we provide may feel pedantic and border-line patronizing to these people. We appreciate that and those people should be proud of their skills and experience. However, not everyone has that level of coding experience and we would like to make the code accessible and usable to them, as well.
